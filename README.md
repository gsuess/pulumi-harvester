# pulumi-harvester
A Pulumi package for creating and managing Harvester resources

WIP: This is a work-in-progress.  Please do not use yet - the state is broken. Help me fix it:


To build you require a docker image named `pulumi-tf-provider-cookiecutter`, which can be obtained [here](https://github.com/gsuess/pulumi-tf-provider-cookiecutter)

```bash
make
make shim_go_mod_tidy
```
